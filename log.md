# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 04 June 2023

**Today's Progress**: Coding environment set-up. Installed Ubuntu on dual booth in my machine. Installed Google Chrome browser and the VS Code editor. Get learned the command line basics including:

* General syntax of shell command
   `$ ls -F /`: prompt | command | options |arguments
    

* Basic commands for coding
1. `cd`: changes directory
2. `cd ..`:shortcut to move up one directory level
3. `cd`: without argument: changes the working directory /home
4. `mkdir`: create a directory
5. `pwd`: display current working directory
5. `mkdir -p`: modify the mkdir to create multiple directories
6. `touch`: create a text file.
7. `cd ~`: navigates to the current user's home dir
8. `cd -`: navigate to the previous directory I was in
9. `ls`: display content within current directory
10. `ls -F` adds a marker to files and directories on display
11. `ls -l`: long list format with additional info
12. `ls -l -h`: display human-readable format of the files.
13. `ls -t`: display while sorted based on time of last modification.
14. `ls -t -r`: displays content of the directories in reverse. Indicate the most recently modified file.
15. `ls -F downloads`: -F option with an argument of directory name facilitates display of files in a separate directory. If directory not sibling of current directory, requires the use of absolute path (specified relative to the root directory)


**Thoughts:**
It is crazy the amount of information about command line that I learnt in a single day. The remaining duty for me is to now undertake serious practice by using the terminal as much as I can. I must be ready to use the terminal in a working environment by the end of the Odin curriculum.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
